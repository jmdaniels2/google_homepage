This is the tool set that I will use to establish a means of communication with others.  This tool set allows for me to communicate between multiple users, and effectively what is a vps... and with that, this tool (github) is utilized as a means to sync all users data streams into one contiguous projection of a larger workflow.

Here is an linke of an exemplary readme.md page organization as an example for future necessity while possibly working in git with others... you can use this to organize what the page looks like so when you need to do this in the future, you look more like you have created a readme.md before:

its worth noting, you toook some time and forgot how to log into the "github" and send docs there, as you had to use the "push feature" to get terminal to change the document, or even to add the document, i believe you have to commit the doc first


***The workflow you needed the most help with ultimately, was that you cant create a repository on github from terminal as there isnt a command for that.

  As well, you can't just type push, you have to firstly and rather annoyingly preface each command with "git" as it wont know wtf youre tlaking about if you dont, and secondly, and even more oddly, you have to `git add` or (stage) and then `git commit`
